## Build and run

This code was written with the help of cabal, and can therefore be build and run using the `cabal build` and `cabal run` commands. This code has been written (and only tested) on windows, so I am unsure if it works on any other opperating system. This being due to the code being heavily reliant upon the use of escape codes and the Windows console.
